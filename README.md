# SQL vs NoSQL
relational vs Non-relational

Structured Query Language vs Not onlyStructured Query Language

SQL - inflexible - for some columns that only specifc row may have, they may isnert null for other rows

NoSQL - MongoDB - flexible, store JSON objects

Scalability:

SQL maybe unstable

MongoDB would split data into small chunks, maybe slow, but stable

MySQL: - more mature, table structure, require a schema, great with relationsbhips. scale vertically

MongoDB - shiny and new, document structure, more flexible to change, not great with complex relationships, horizontally scalable
